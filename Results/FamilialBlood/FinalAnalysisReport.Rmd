#Data Sets

Datasets were searched for using the same filters as before - must be human tissue that expressed lewy bodies, must have at least 3 patients and 3 controls, and must...

10 datasets were identified:

#Quality Control - PD_QC.R

Checked data distribution using PCA and boxplots. Some of the datasets have quite mixed samples wereas others separate quite nicely into controls and patients. Boxplots didn't suggest any samples were outliers.

## Common DEGs
As before, I ran either Limma or DESeq2 and looked for common fold change direction across all 10 datasets. Filtering populations I used were ALS samples (for neurodegeneration), familial blood (for any general familial PD signal + tissue non-specific), and sporadic blood (for generic sporadic signal + tissue non-specific). 

Overlap minus these filtration datasets left 210 genes this time (ALS_sfblood_ALLgenes.txt). Overlapping with Malacards PD genes shows presence of 6 PD-associated genes, including alpha synuclein itself.

## Functional Enrichment
Functional enrichment in EnrichR for [upregulated](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=41d5a) and [downregulated](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=41d5z) genes. 

Upregulated signal isn't entirely clear; a number of signalling and DNA-binding pathways are enriched but not with the strongest p values. Alternatively there is quite a strong signal in the downregulated genes. A number of neurodegenerative pathways (inc Parkinson's disease) are enriched, as well as the electron transport chain/mitochondrial processes (mitochondrion (GO:0005739)	padj = 4.711e-8, 23 genes). GO Biological Process also implicates autophagy, which highlights the presence of CHMP2B - a causative ALS/FTLD gene.

##Protein Interaction Network

Using the 210 DEGs I seeded a network of 2429 nodes and 4097 edges.

## Common Coexpression

I ran common coexpression again using Sharc. DUM was again removed because it had ~100,000 fewer edges than the other datasets. I then plotted the distributions of rho values to check they were normally distributed:

![](/Users/clairegreen/Documents/PhD/Parkinsons/Parkinsons_Code/Results/FamilialBlood/RhoDiagram.jpg)

From this it is clear that the LEW and MOR.FC datasets do not have the power for a normal coexpression distribution. These two datasets were therefore removed from the common coexpression edge analysis. 

When looking for a common edge, I tried three different minimum Rho values; 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3. 

###Threshold of 0.5

###Threshold of 0.4
![](/Users/clairegreen/Documents/PhD/Parkinsons/Parkinsons_Code/Results/FamilialBlood/PD_0point4.jpg)


###Threshold of 0.3
![](/Users/clairegreen/Documents/PhD/Parkinsons/Parkinsons_Code/Results/FamilialBlood/PD_0point3.jpg)


The largest connected component consists of 82 genes and 95 edges. 

### Largest Connected Component of 0.3

### IrefIndex 14.0 PPI between PD Malacards and LCC 
![](/Users/clairegreen/Documents/PhD/Parkinsons/Parkinsons_Code/Results/FamilialBlood/0point3_PPI.jpg)

Here we can see that there are 25 LCC proteins which forming 45 PPI relationships with 25 PD Malacard genes (1 overlap of PARK7)

##VarElect

Although already noted, the VarElect results clearly show the membership of PARK7 in the network. The interesting thing about PARK7 being here is that it is more commonly associated with early-onset or juvenile Parkinson's disease. Another interesting point is that, although PARK7 PD is early-onset, it's classified by UniProt as having "slow progression and initial good response to levodopa". 

CYCS or Cytochrome C, Somatic, is a small heme protein that functions as a central component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It is closely related to Parkinson's disease in the literature due to its apparent malfuction in the disease.
